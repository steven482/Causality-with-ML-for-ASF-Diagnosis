# Causality-with-ML-for-ASF-Diagnosis
This study investigates the causal relationship between African swine fever (ASF) viral load and disease severity in domestic and wild pigs using machine learning models. A causality model with linear regression and random forest regressor was developed to analyse ASF transmission dynamics and symptom severity.
